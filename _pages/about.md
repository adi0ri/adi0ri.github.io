Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at California State University, Chico, where I dive deep into topics like Artificial Intelligence, Graph Theory, and Data Science. Before this, I earned my Bachelor's in Information Technology from the University of Delhi, which set the foundation for my passion for technology and problem-solving.

When I’m not busy with coursework, you can usually find me outdoors appreciating nature, hiking up trails, or indulging in my love for food, whether that's cooking up something new or discovering hidden culinary gems. I also enjoy unwinding with video games, belting out songs at karaoke nights.

Feel free to explore my projects and experiences here. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share a curiosity for tech and a zest for life, so, if you have an idea and want to see if I’d be interested in helping out, please contact me!
